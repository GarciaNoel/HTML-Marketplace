# HTML-Marketplace

## About

This is an AI desktop app it wraps javascript for HTML apps.

The AI marketplace is HTML. An HTML gui marketplace runs on a desktop application.
LLM wrapper frontends are bound to get stuck at the HTML marketplace because
of it becoming a freemium model. If you want to run LLM wrapped applications
then you will want the one with a marketplace and that will be HTML. There is 
no other GUI toolkit that is being used forever already.

I have the inspiration to develop an Electron application in HTML files that
the application loads after starting. 

## Development

To run this:
```bash
npm run start
```
